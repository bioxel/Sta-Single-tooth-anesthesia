. 12V 3A Power Supply:
2. L298N Motor Driver:
•	Connect OUT1 and OUT2 of the L298N to the terminals of the peristaltic pump.
•	Connect IN1 on the L298N to Arduino pin 6 (PWM pin for motor speed control).

3. Peristaltic Pump:
•	Connect the pump’s motor terminals to OUT1 and OUT2 on the L298N motor driver.
•	Ensure the pump’s operating voltage matches the 12V provided by the L298N.

4. Arduino:
•	Connect the Arduino VIN to the  line of  the 12 V power supply for logic-level control.
•	Connect Arduino GND to the GND of the 12V power supply (common ground with L298N).
•	Connect Arduino pin 6 to IN1 on the L298N for motor speed control.

5. Push Buttons:
Start Button (Momentary):
•	Connect one terminal of the start button to Arduino pin 7.
•	Connect the other terminal of the start button to Arduino GND.
Reset Button (Momentary):
•	Connect one terminal of the reset button to Arduino pin 8.
•	Connect the other terminal of the reset button to Arduino GND.

6. Potentiometer:
•	Connect one side of the potentiometer to 5V on the Arduino.
•	Connect the other side to GND.
•	Connect the middle (signal) pin of the potentiometer to Arduino A0.

7. LCD (I2C):
•	Connect the VCC pin of the LCD to 5V on the Arduino.
•	Connect the GND pin of the LCD to Arduino GND.
•	Connect the SDA pin of the LCD to Arduino A4.
•	Connect the SCL pin of the LCD to Arduino A5.
